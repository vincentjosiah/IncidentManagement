# IncidentManagement with PowerBI


## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to store a bunch of data about incidents in a relational database and create a dashboard in PowerBI that represents the interesting facts about the incidents.

## Project Summary
For this project the data needs to be extracted and structured in a relational database where it is easy to work with and that marries well with PowerBI.  PowerBI will then directly connect to the database and query and transform the data as necessary, and evaluate the incidents.

This is important because otherwise measuring time taken and categorizing for various priorities would be completely manual. It also gives insight into where a company could improve and focus their energy on solving problems faster.

I will execute this by extracting my data from my source.  Storing in an online sql database. Connecting the database to PowerBI. Transforming the data as necessary. Creating the dashboard in PowerBI.
